#Background
This is the effort of the Office of General Counsel (OGC) to scan and publish older laws of the Council of the District of Columbia.
#What you'll find
In the "Laws" folder, I plan to place the PDFs of the Laws from Council Periods 1-8 (1975-1990). We will be adding metadata as well for easy reference.
#Status
This is a work-in-progress.
#License
These are public domain. At the moment, these are not considered official records of the Council.
